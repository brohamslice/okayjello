    Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall with your friend
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance

Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again

That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is a gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn
Girl, you really change my life

Doing things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cooking things she likes
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is the gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me
Ay, I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me

Ay, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Shawty got me singing
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Now she got me singing

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
